ONE TOUCH(R) II RS-232 COMMUNICATION MODE SPECIFICATION

The information contained in this specification is proprietary to
LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, CA.  LifeScan reserves the right to change any
of this information at any time without notice.  There is no warranty,
expressed or implied, for any use of this information, on any device
built using this information except those approved by LifeScan Inc., or
for any damage to a ONE TOUCH(R) II Meter caused by any device using the
data port except for those devices approved by LifeScan Inc.

RS-232

  The "RS-232" option is the default mode for the ONE TOUCH(R) II meter.
  Asynchronous RS-232 communications takes place at 300, 1200, 2400, or
  9600 bps, selectable by the user.  Data are transferred as 8 bit
  characters with no parity and one stop bit.  Communications is via a
  three wire (RS-232 designations of BA, BB, AB) cable with XOFF/XON
  handshaking on data transmission from the meter.

  The ONE TOUCH(R) II meter "mimics' its LCD screen by transmitting the
  contents of each screen in six or more character messages each
  followed by a carriage return.  Additional characters (more than six)
  are transmitted when a screen contains one or more decimal points or
  the colon.  XOFF/XON pacing is not in effect while the meter is
  mimicing.  To assist a program in interpreting the messages, the first
  message transmitted on power up is the selected language (e.g.,
  ENGL.).

  Serial messages are encoded as ASCII characters.  All numbers, except
  the checksums and the Strip code number specified by the 'DMSS'
  command are decimal.  All non "mimic mode" messages are checksummed
  and the hexadecimal representation of the 16 bit checksum (a blank
  followed by four characters) is placed at the end of each message,
  just before the carriage return, line feed pair.

  "RS-232" Commands (the 'DM' prefix is not echoed):
    DMT...  * set the date and time of the meter's clock (mm/dd/yy hh:mm)
    DMF     * send date and time from meter's clock
    DMZ     * zero the meter's datalog
    DMP     * dump datalog from meter's memory
    DMS..   * change or display the meter's status (defaults)

  (Note, the meter should be turned on and flashing "INSERT STRIP" during
  data transmission.)

  Responses to "RS-232" commands"

    'T"dow","mm/dd/yy","hh:mm:ss xM" cksm'
      meter's clock has been set to the indicated date and time:
      dow - derived day of week ('SUN',...,'SAT' in selected language)
      date (mm/dd/yy)(M.D.Y.) or (dd/mm/yy)(D.M.Y.)
      time (hh:mm:ss xM)(AM/PM) or (hh:mm:ss  )(24:00)

      Time is entered as 'DMTmm/dd/yy hh:mm' or 'DMTmm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss',
      always with the month first and the hours in 24:00 format. The
      meter doesn't echo the data and time until it has been set.
      If the format or value of the entered date or time is invalid,
      the existing value is retained and nothing but the 'T cksm' is
      echoed.  The day of the week is not entered.  The entered date
      separator may be either a slash ('/') or a dash ('-').  The
      seconds are cleared to zero if not entered.  Permissible clock
      setting range is 1/1/84 0:0:0 to 12/31/14 23:59:59 or 31 years.

    'F"dow","mm/dd/tt","hh:mm:ss xM" cksm'
      current date and time from the meter's clock, encoded as:
      dow - derived day of week ('SUN',...,'SAT' in selected language)
      date (mm/dd/yy)(M.D.Y.) or (dd/mm/yy)(D.M.Y.)
      time (hh:mm:ss xM)(AM/PM) or (hh:mm:ss  )(24:00)

    'Z 005A'  meter's datalog is being cleared.  Takes about three
              seconds to execute since the entire datalog RAM (2KB)
	      is tested.  The checksum is transmitted and the meter
	      is reset upon completion.

    'P nnn,"MeterSN","ENGL. ","M.D.Y. ","AM/PM","MG/DL","!min","!max" cksm'
      nnn - number of datalog records to follow (0-250)
      "MeterSN" - the nine character meter serial number
      "ENGL. ","ESPAN.", etc - the currently selected language
      "M.D.Y. " or "D.M.Y. ", etc - the selected date format
      "AM/PM" or "24:00 " - the selected time format
      "MG/DL" or "MMOL/L" - the unit of measure for glucose values
      "!min" and "!max" - the meter's checkstrip range

    followed by nnn records of:
    'P "dow","mm/dd/yy","hh:mm:00 xM"," nnn ",n cksm'
              date          time    glucose event
      dow - derived day of week ('SUN',...,'SAT' in selected language)
      date of reading (mm/dd/yy)(M.D.Y.) or (dd/mm/yy)(D.M.Y.)
      time of reading (hh:mm:00 xM)(AM/PM) or (hh:mm:00  )(24:00)

      glucose value formatting (there are language variations):
        If the datalog record had a checksum error, the last character
          is forced to be a question mark (e.g., '...," nnn?",...') All
          data in a record so flagged must be considered "suspect".
        If glucose > 600 mg/dL, '...," HIGH ",...' is transmitted.
        If UNITS are mmol/L, '...,"MMnn.n ",...' is transmitted.
        If a checkstrip reading, ',,,,"! nnn ",...' (mg/dL) or
          '...,"! n.n ",...' (mmol/L) is transmitted.
        If flagged as control solution, '...,"C nnn ",...' (mg/dL) or
          '...,"C nn.n ",...' (mmol/L) is transmitted.  (The 'C' becomes
          a 'K' if the languages is SVENS or DEUTS.)

    Use of the data management 'DMSCx' command can destroy on-going
    communications.  Issuing 'DMSC1', 'DMSC2', or 'DMSC3' will immediately
    disable RS-232 and response to any commands.  To reset, the user must
    manually reset the meter's defaults by holding down the MB on power-up
    and changing the communications mode.

CABLING

We recommend using the ONE TOUCH(R) Interface Cable from LifeScan.  The
cable can be used to connect a ONE TOUCH(R) II Meter to the serial port
(communication port) of an IBM(R), or compatible, personal computer.
The ONE TOUCH Interface Cable may be adapted for use with a Macintosh
computer by using a Mac Plus/SE/II to Hayes Modem (or equivalent) Cable
which will interface the DB-25 connector to the Macintosh communication
port.

For cable availability, please call the LifeScan Technical Services
Department.
  U.S.A.    1 (800) 227-8862
  Canada    1 (800) 663-5521

ONE TOUCH Interface Cable Pinout:
  DB-25 pin
        2    TXD    transmitted data from computer to meter
        3    RXD    received data from meter to computer
	4    RTS    request to send from computer
	6    DSR    data set ready to computer (connected to DTR)
	7    GND    signal ground
	20   DTR    data terminal ready from computer

The following conditions must be met to enable the ONE TOUCH Interface
Cable to work with the ONE TOUCH II Meter in RS-232 mode:

  1.  The computer must assert (apply a positive RS-232 voltage to) RTS
      and/or DTR.  Either or both of these signals supply power to the
      cable circuitry.

  2.  The computer may leave RTS "open" but may not drive it to a
      negative RS-232 level.

  3.  The meter must be set in RS-232 mode at the same transmission rate
      (9600, 300, 1200, or 2400 bps) as the computer.  The computer
      communications port must be set to 8 data bits, no parity, and one
      stop bit.
