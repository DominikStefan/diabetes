RS-232 COMMUNICATION

The ONE TOUCH(R) Profile(TM) Meter supports asynchronous, RS-232
communications via the data port at 9600 baud only.  The "Data
Manager" signaling scheme used by the One Touch and GlucoScan 3000
Meters, and the "DATA A" and "DATA B" data formats supported by
the ONE TOUCH(R) II are NOT supported.  Data are transferred as
8-bit characters with no parity and one stop bit.  Communications
is via three-wire (RS-232 designations of BA, BB, AB) cable with
XON/XOFF handshaking supported on transmissions from the Meter,
except for mimicked messages (see below).

MIMICKING

The ONE TOUCH(R) Profile(TM) Meter "mimics" its LCD screen by
transmitting comma delimited, ASCII text records.  The minimum
length record (blank screen, except, possibly, one or more icons)
is 14 bytes:

        n,"",m,"",""

The maximum length record (all decimal points and colons) is 47 bytes:

        n,"12.3",m,"1.2.:3.4.5.6.","12:3456789ABCDEF"

The "normal" record is about 38 bytes:

        n,"123",m,"123456","123456789ABCDEF"
           line 1  line 2        line 3

where:
n       encodes the Memory and Battery icons as:
  0     neither icon displayed
  1     Memory displayed
  2     Battery displayed
  3     Memory and Battery displayed

m       encodes the UNITS, mg/dL, and mmol/L icons as:
  0     none displayed
  1     mmol/L displayed
  2     mg/dL displayed
  3     mmol/L and mg/dL displayed
  4     UNITS displayed
  5     mmol/L and UNITS displayed
  6     mg/dL and UNITS displayed
  7     mmol/L, mg/dL, and UNITS displayed

For example, the following screen will be mimicked as follows:

+---------------+
|  M  120 mg/dL |       1,"120",2," AVG  ","       30-DAY  " 
|               |
|     AVG       |
|    30-day     |
+---------------+

                                Page 2 of 9
 
RS-232 "DM" COMMANDS

Serial commands and responses are encoded as ASCII characters.  A
checksum is generated for all non "mimicked" messages and the
hexadecimal representation of the least significant 16 bits of the
checksum (a blank followed by 4 characters) is placed at the end
of each response message, Just before the carriage return (<CR>),
line feed (<LF>) pair.

In order to keep the meter from automatically powering down, the
external device should periodically send "DMT<CR>".  This causes
the meter to respond with "T 0054" and to reset the automatic
power-down time-out to 2 minutes.  Not that the "DMS...", "DMP",
"DMI", "DMX", and "DM^" commands also reset the automatic power-down
time-out to 2 minutes.

Commands are handled in the order they are received.  All responses
will be in English, regardless of the current language setting.
Note that some commands require termination with a carriage return
(<CR>) while others do not.  Also note that the brackets ("[]")
denote optional parameters and are NOT part of the actual command.

COMMAND         ACTION/RESPONSE

DM?             Returns the software version number and creation
                date, where "x" is the calibration data block format
                code ("M" for example"), "nn.nn.nn" is the software
                version number ("71.00.00" for example), and mm/dd/yy
                is the software creation date.

                ?xnn.nn.nn mm/dd/yy cksm<CR><LF>

======================================================================

DM@             Returns the meter's unique, non-digit serial number
                assigned during calibration.  This command is
                intended to be used to identify the meter connected
                to the external device's serial port.

                @ "XXX1234ZG" cksm<CR><LF>

======================================================================

DM^[nnn]<CR>    Changes the current "new-data-marker" to "nnn"
		(0 - 250) and returns the new value.  If "nnn" is
		invalid or not specified, the current setting is
		returned.  This value represents the number of
		readings taken since the "new-data-marker" was last
		set.  For example, if only the most recent 100
		results were desired, sending "DM^100" would
		effectively erase results older than the most recent
		100 results.  Sending "DM^250" recovers all the
		results.  Sending "DM^0" erases all results.  Note
		that this command manipulates the datalog information
		record, but does not affect any of the stored
		results.

                ^ nnn cksm<CR><LF>

======================================================================

DMF             Returns the current date and time from the meter's
                clock in the selected date and time formats.

        F "dow","mm/dd/yy","hh:mm:ss xM" cksm<CR><LF>  for (M-D-Y, AM/PM)
        F "dow","mm/dd/yy","hh:mm:ss   " cksm<CR><LF>  for (M-D-Y, 24:00)
        F "dow","dd/mm/yy","hh:mm:ss xM" cksm<CR><LF>  for (D-M-Y, AM/PM)
        F "dow","dd/mm/yy","hh:mm:ss   " cksm<CR><LF>  for (D-M-Y, 24:00)

        "dow" ("day-of-week") = SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT.

                                Page 3 of 9
 
COMMAND         ACTION/RESPONSE

DMI             Dumps the datalog from the meter's memory.  The
                response is always transmitted in English in the
                selected units, date, and time formats.  A header
                is sent first, which contains information about
                the format of the data and how many records will
                follow.  Each datalog record is transmitted next.
                Leading zeroes are suppressed.

                in M-D-Y format) and time (entered in 24 hour
                format).  If seconds are not specified, seconds
                are set to zero.  Returns the new meter clock date
                and time after the clock has been successfully set,
                or returns "T 0054" if the date and/or time specified
                was invalid.  The date must be specified as
                "month-day-year", and the separator can be slash
                (`/') or dash (`-').  The clock setting range is

CABLING

We recommend using the ONE TOUCH(R) Interface Cable from LifeScan.
This cable can be used to connect a ONE TOUCH(R) Profile(TM) Meter
to the serial port (communication port) of an IBM, or compatible,
personal computer.  The ONE TOUCH(R) Interface Cable may be adapted
for use with a Macintosh computer by using a Hayes Modem, or
equivalent, cable which will interface the DB-25 connector to the
Macintosh communication port.

For cable availability, please call the LifeScan Technical Services
Department.
U.S.A           1 (800) 227-8862
Canada          1 (800) 663-5521

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The following conditions must be met to enable the ONE TOUCH(R)
Interface Cable to work with the ONE TOUCH(R) Profile(TM) Meter:

    1.  The computer must assert (apply a positive RS-232 voltage
        to) RTS and/or DTR.  Either or both of these signals supply
        power to the cable circuitry.

    2.  The computer may leave RTS "open" but may not drive it to
        a negative RS-232 level.

    3.  The computer communications port must be set to 9600 baud,
        8 data bits, no parity, and one stop bit.
